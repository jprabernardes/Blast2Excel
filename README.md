# Blast2Excel

This Python script parses multiple GenBank-format files from a folder named `input_folder` and extracts useful biological and metadata fields into a single Excel spreadsheet.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- The following Python packages:

```
pandas
biopython
openpyxl
```

Install them using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 📁 Folder Structure

```
your-project/
├── parse_genbank.py               # ← The script
├── README.md                      # ← This file
├── requirements.txt               # ← Dependency list
├── output_folder/                 # ← Output folder (created automatically if missing)
│   └── genbank_parsed_all.xlsx    # ← Output file (generated by the script)
└── input_folder/                  # ← Input folder (created automatically if missing)
    ├── file1.gbk
    ├── file2.gb
    └── ...
```

## 🧾 Input Files

Place your GenBank-style files in the `input_folder/` directory. Accepted extensions:

- `.gb`
- `.gbk`
- `.fasta`
- `.txt`

The files must follow the GenBank flat file format (with sections like `LOCUS`, `DEFINITION`, `ACCESSION`, `FEATURES`, `ORIGIN`, etc.).

## 🔍 Fields Extracted

For each GenBank entry, the script extracts:

- `File` (source file name)
- `Accession`
- `Definition`
- `Organism`
- `Host` (if present)
- `Geo_location` (if present)
- `Isolation_source` (if present)
- `Features` (e.g. rRNA, misc_RNA, ITS, with locations and products)

Feature format:

```
<type> (<location>) → <product>
```

Example:
```
rRNA (210..369) → 5.8S ribosomal RNA
```

## 📤 Output

The script generates:

```
output_folder/genbank_parsed_all.xlsx
```

Each row in the spreadsheet corresponds to one GenBank entry.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Ensure Python and required libraries are installed.
2. Run the script:

```bash
python Blast2Excel.py
```

- If `input_folder` or `output_folder` doesn't exist, they will be created automatically.
- Messages will inform you if any folder was missing and created.
